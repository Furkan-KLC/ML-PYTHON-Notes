Machine learning is science of programming that make machines capable of learn from data 
if you ask why we are using machine learning because it is very efficient and fast.


SYSTEMS OF MACHINE LEARNING :
----------------------------
there are several types of machine learning systems we can compare them whether or not they are trained under human control [ (supervised or not (unsupervised) or 
Reinforcement Learning,Semi supervised learning ]

Whether or not they can learn incrementally on the fly (online versus batch learning)

Whether they work by simply comparing new data points to known data points,
or instead detect patterns in the training data and build a predictive model, much
like scientists do (instance-based versus model-based learning)
lets look closer to thoose systems.



SUPERVISED/UNSUPERVISED LEARNING:
---------------------------------
Machine Learning systems can be classified according to the amount and type of
supervision they get during training. There are four major categories: supervised
learning, unsupervised learning, semisupervised learning, and Reinforcement Learn‚Äê
